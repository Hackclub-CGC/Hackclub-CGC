HACK CLUB COMMUNITY- CGC

PRINCIPLES:
1.	HACK CLUB COMMUNITY's main motive is to help students in their projects and improving student's communication skills and increasing their knowledge by sharing with others.
2.	We believe in teamwork and co-operation, which means students who are not talkative or introverted are free to come and open up themselves. 
3.	Helping each other, we made this community to help each other, so any type of help students require will be given to them if possible.
4.	Discipline and seriousness, students must be serious about this as this is not like any college club where you have boundaries. We have many boundaries (please read Terms and Conditions).
5.	Willingness to learn and share, we choose to be a community because of only one reason that you are free to come (please read our Terms and Conditions). We need only passionate and learners in our community.
6.	WE ARE NOT MAKING THIS FOR RECOGNITION!!

Hacker Values
These are the values to which people in the Hack Club community should aspire.
•Be friendly and welcoming
•Be patient
•Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language (meaning and tone can be lost in translation).
•Be thoughtful
•Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
•Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
•Be respectful
•In particular, respect differences of opinion.
•Be charitable
•Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
•When we do disagree, try to understand why.
•Avoid destructive behavior:
•Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
•Unconstructive criticism: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
•Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
•Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
•Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.
