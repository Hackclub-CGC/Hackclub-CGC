## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Write clear meaningful git commit messages.
3. Always create PR to `develop` branch.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## How to contibute
**1.** Fork the repository.

**2.** Clone the forked repository.

```terminal
git clone repo-url
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

```terminal
cd repo folder
```

**4.** Create a new branch.

```terminal
git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
```

**5.** Make changes in source code.

**6.** Commit your changes.

```terminal
  git add .
  git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

**7.** Push your local branch to the remote repository.

```terminal
git push -u origin <your_branch_name>
```

**8.** Create a PR!
